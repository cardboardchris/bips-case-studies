<p>
    Twelve years ago you founded Inter‐City Opera, a regional opera company in the Triad—the region of North Carolina that includes Greensboro, Winston-Salem and High Point.  Working out of a high school gymnasium for two years before getting the capital to renovate your own theater, you are highly invested in the success of Inter-City Opera. You built a strong board of local community members that included politicians, wealthy philanthropists, business advisors, developers, artists and lawyers.  Growing slowly, the company began to gain positive recognition for productions of traditional operas such as <i>Carmen</i> and <i>La Boheme</i>.  After a few years, however, you noticed that your audiences were mostly older people, with few young people attending and not much audience diversity.  There also wasn’t much growth in audiences from year to year.  You became bored producing traditional repertoire year to year. But when you and Opera North Carolina co-produced a new opera based on the bestseller novel <i>Fireflight</i>, the ticket was a hot news item and the performances sold out.  Audiences were younger and more diverse.  It was artistically and personally invigorating. Energized, you decided to branch out from the traditional repertoire and try your hand at more experimental operas going forward.
