            "answer": "I’m very concerned about bringing these people here. The government seems to be bending over backwards to let these people in and accommodate them, when we already have so many pressing problems of our own to deal with here. I don’t see why we should be responsible for them. And really, do we know who these people are? Who’s to say they’re not terrorists? We’ve had quite enough of that over the years, I think. No, I say let one of the richer districts take them in, if anyone must. We have hundreds of immigrants already—all the Poles, and the Hungarians, and the Serbs, and whatnot. I don’t feel we should have to make room for any more than we already have. It’s hard enough for us here as it is."

            "question": "If we were to try and make room for the refugees, how would you do it?",
            "answer": "I suppose they’ll just try and cram them into those shoddy little apartments in New Ringelberg. Or build them new housing, and a new tram line for that, and then I suppose they’ll need shops for their special meats. And of course, then we’ll need to build them mosques, won’t we? And there you have it—it will be like a ghetto for these people, all these Turks or Afghans or whoever they are, with their own language and customs imported here. No effort to fit in. It will be just like those areas you see in Berlin. All of this, and the government gives them money, too. Well, those of us who’ve always lived here don’t get such special treatment, let me tell you. And I think you will see that many of the people you talk to feel the same way I do about all of this. No, I say let one of the richer districts take them in, if anyone must."

            "answer": "I’m for it, yes, absolutely. What has happened to these people is an absolute travesty, a failure on the part of the West to step in when we should have, and end the genocide against the Syrian people. No matter what their circumstances were before all of this, they are now refugees, and they deserve our help. We have the resources and the ability, and we should also have the will to extend our hand to them. So I say, bring it on. Change is coming, one way or another. Let’s embrace it, make it a positive change for all of us. I think it’s the least we can do."

            "question": "Tell me more about the positive changes you see.",
            "answer": "This area in particular, it’s not the nicest, perhaps, but let’s face it—the old East has been slowly dying for as long as I’ve been alive, hasn’t it? And you see it here more than anywhere in Erfurt, probably. Look at all the money the EU pumped into this place to fix up all the old Communist-era apartments, to make them modern and acceptable to live in. And still, we have so many vacant places falling slowly into disrepair. Nobody really wants to live in this part of the city, except those looking to make their start in life. So, who better than these families, who come to us practically empty-handed, except for what they’ve been able to carry on their backs? It would bring fresh blood, new life to this part of the city. We have to accept that these people are coming, and we need to reckon with that up front—be proactive about it, not reactive. I feel if we welcome them, make room for them, give them a place to build a new home, it will be much better for everyone in the long run."

            "question": "Tell us what you think about the immigration of people into Krämpfervorstadt.",
            "answer": "Well, what can you say—it’s not the most beautiful place in the world. Even though we’re quite close to the center of town, it feels a little bit isolated, so it’s not so easy to get around if you don’t have a car. But it’s not such a bad place, especially when you consider where many of us have come from. Me and my family have been here almost a year now, before this big wave of people coming in, and sure, it’s quite different from life back home, but it is life. There is stability here for my wife and children, and such peace. We need not fear bombs in the night, or gunfire on the streets. I don’t have to worry so much for my son and daughter. They have stability, and even if we don’t have a lot of money, well, we would have even less comfort if we were still in Aleppo. Many of these people who will come, they may come from quite comfortable lives back in Syria, like we did—but those lives, those cities don’t exist anymore. All they are leaving behind is dust, and bombs, and terror. That’s no way to live. That’s why they are coming here. It’s why me and my family came. Like us, they will start again, from the bottom, and it will be hard—but it can be done. What choice do they have? Better to come here, to this foreign place with its foreign ways, and try to start a new life, than to stay where they are, and watch their lives crumble—or have no life at all."

            "question": "Are you ready for more immigrants to come?",
            "answer": "I am ready for more to come, sure. More Arab people and Arabic speakers, yes, so that we have people we have more in common with. People who share our customs and culture, our traditions. This has been the most difficult part—our culture, Arab culture, and our language is very different from the Germans’. It was a lot for me and my family to get used to—the way they eat, dress, their language. I am sure we were a lot for them to get used to as well! I think this will be the biggest problem for everyone—differences like this. I do worry that a lot of small differences will add up to some very large ones, and cause problems for us all. But that is a problem for the future—these people are coming here now, no matter what. And sure, not everyone is so welcoming to foreigners here—but on the whole, it’s been really heart-warming, to see the response to the refugees. It makes you really feel that humans, we’re decent people, no matter where we come from. We all have the same interest in making things better for everyone, especially the children. Giving them an opportunity to live, you know? We can’t guarantee that where we come from. But we can do it here. I think that’s the most important thing. Everything else, the details of life and starting anew, we can figure all of that out. So long as the children can live."

            "answer": "Well, look, no matter what else—at the end of the day, it always comes down to money, doesn’t it? The money Berlin is willing to put into this, the money the Mayor puts up. I would expect the EU, maybe the UN to help out, too. It can’t all come from us. We’re already propping up southern Europe as it is. And, you know, I don’t think all of these people are poor. I hear many of them are middle-class, quite comfortable, and even if they’ve had to leave their possessions behind, they’re not exactly impoverished. So I don’t know how impressed they would be with this part of town—I mean, come on, it’s Krämpfervorstadt, not Frankfurt, right? But then, you know, the rich parts of town, I don’t think they would like the idea of having these people at all. Not long-term, anyway—sooner or later, these people would probably wind up here anyway. We already have more migrants here than any other district—I’m sure the other districts would think, what’s the harm in a few more? So it all seems a little bit inevitable to me."

            "question": "What do the additional immigrants mean for Krämpfervorstadt?",
            "answer": "I don’t want to sound like a mercenary or anything, but here’s the reality of it—things have been tough down here, for a long time. Ever since Reunification. If these people really want to stay, if we need to build new housing to accommodate them—and there are thousands coming, after all—then that means infrastructure and investment. We have the space here. And we need the investment, for sure. Extend the tramlines, develop some of the greenfields, more schools and stores and housing. I know in Berlin, all the old West German places, they think of us here as the rust belt still. That there’s no future here. Well, who knows—maybe these immigrants are our future. Maybe there’s opportunities for everybody, am I right? I’d like to see some new blood around here. Some life in this place. Not just for Erfurt, but particularly for Krämpfervorstadt. It’s a chance for a new start, I think, for the refugees, and for us too."
