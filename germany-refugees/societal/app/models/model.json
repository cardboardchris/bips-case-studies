            "question": "What can be done about the recent immigration of people into Erfurt? Is Erfurt prepared for this influx of people?",
            "answer": "If you’re talking about can we do this? Yes, I think we are well-placed. It all comes down to logistics. In terms of housing, short- and long-term, we have plenty of space available. We will need to add teachers and healthcare professionals who have the right language skills and cultural training, but that’s possible. We have a lot of underused resources in this city that we can offer these people."

        {
            "question": "What kinds of resources are being underused, and what other resources do we need?",
            "answer": "Of course, the question comes down to money. We’re going to need outside investment, or partnerships, both public and private—federal resources, EU money, and definitely some assistance from the UN. We should be looking to the bigger cities for help—not necessarily financial, but logistical. Tap them for their ideas, see what has worked for them. Ultimately, this could be a good chance to reinvent Erfurt, in terms of infrastructure, resources, the whole face of the community. This kind of thing will be ongoing into the future, and we need to be preparing for the new realities of an even more multicultural Europe. This part of Germany, we haven’t had to do a lot of this, but we can’t put our heads in the sand and pretend this will just go away."

            "question": "Tell us what you think about the recent immigration of people into Erfurt.",
            "answer": "If you ask me personally, I feel we have an obligation to help these people, for sure. But there are certain basic, yet difficult questions we need to ask. Are we prepared for the consequences of bringing in a large number of unemployed, possibly traumatized people who don’t know our culture and customs? Crime could be an issue, especially with a large number of young, single men who have nothing to do. And that raises, of course, the question of who these people really are. Let’s not forget the lessons of the January 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices and the November 2015 Paris attacks in which people were killed at a concert and the March 2016 bombings in Brussels, Belgium, at airports and a metro station. Yes, sure, they look like refugees, but we need to be absolutely certain of this. The community has a lot of questions, and there is a high amount of apprehension out there."
        },
        {
            "question": "You mentioned apprehension; what is your main concern?",
            "answer": "My chief concern is that this will really bring out the anti-immigrant crowd. We’ve already seen some protests and demonstrations—the far-right, with their banners and marches and so forth. Not a lot of participants so far, and most of them seem to be outside agitators from other parts of the country—but we need to be cautious. We don’t want any bigger incidents, anything that could reflect badly on not just Erfurt, but the whole country, especially with Germany’s history, and the way others look at us for our past. It doesn’t take much for a small ember to kindle into a big fire, does it? That’s the last thing we need here. Busloads of right-wing agitators coming here, stirring up our community, and of course, bringing the world’s media with them. I agree that this could be a transformative moment for our city, but it could all go wrong so easily."

            "question": "Tell us what you think about the recent immigration of people into Erfurt.",
            "answer": "Generally, we see a lot of upside to this. Outside funding to help revive the housing stock to accommodate these people will help property owners. These people will need to buy things—food, clothing, phone cards, internet time—and they will have a government allowance to spend. That can only be good for our merchants, who could really use the business. So it could revitalize some areas of the city which badly need it, which is good for the whole city. And then, of course, there are the farms and businesses who have a hard time getting Germans to do certain necessary jobs. I’m sure many of the refugees will want to work, if they can, so that’s a win-win for everyone."
        },
        {
            "question": "“A win-win for everyone,” you said; many people do not see it that way. Can you comment?",
            "answer": "Yeah, we do need to be mindful of the idea of “immigrants stealing our jobs.” That’s long been a problem, not just here, but all over Western Europe. Especially now, with the overall economy so weak. But ultimately, I think new, long-term residents can really help reinvigorate the city, bring in new revenues—and not just for us in the business community, but for you in the government, with taxes and so forth. The really big benefit, though? Helping to reverse the population decline and flight from this part of the country. We really could use the new lifeblood here. So it means a change in our community, but change is coming, one way or another. This is a change we can harness for the good of everyone."

            "question": "Tell us what you think about the recent immigration of people into Erfurt.",
            "answer": "There are certainly a lot of concerns on the ground, across many of our neighborhoods, but people seem welcoming in general. There’s a willingness to extend our hand to these people. We may not be rich here, but we’re comfortable, especially compared to what these refugees have gone through. We have enough to go around. We have the room. It’s important, however, to work closely with communities where resettlement will take place, to ensure smooth integration. Education will be key to this—showing the people of Erfurt there is nothing to fear, that these are not Arab terrorists, or any of the other nonsense the fearmongers are peddling. These are people, just like us. They can bring new life to our city, which we sorely need."
        },
        {
            "question": "You mentioned smooth integration; what challenges need to be overcome to accomplish that?",
            "answer": "The cultural sensitivities are proving tricky to navigate, and that’s where the education comes in. I mean, we’re Germans—we like our beer, we like our pork, those things are part of our culture. But for many of these immigrants, those things are alien to their cultures, even offensive. I hear a lot of people saying they’re afraid we’ll have to cancel Oktoberfest, that all the butchers will have to be halal now. It seems a little ridiculous, but it’s rooted in some real concerns. I get asked if we’re going to build them mosques, let them practice sharia law, that kind of stuff. We do need to accommodate their cultural sensitivities, but in order for this whole experiment to work for the long-term, we have to find common ground, and also make sure that we aren’t neglecting Erfurters’ needs for the sake of the refugees. We must find a balance."
