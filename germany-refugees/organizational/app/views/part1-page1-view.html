    As a district council member in Krämpfervorstadt, you&rsquo;re used to dealing with district challenges. (Click here to listen to the pronunciation of <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_lS51u0zhfycFp6NFcxNy1yX3c" target="_blank">Krämpfervorstadt</a>). The responsibilities of your position and fellow council members include reviewing the needs of your district, including oversight of road construction and maintenance, social welfare, housing, waste management, tourism promotion, libraries, and higher education.

    The city of Erfurt is one of the frontline organizations dealing with the influx of refugees. It&rsquo;s a big challenge—Erfurt has a very small immigrant/non-German population. In addition to providing for the needs of the existing residents of Erfurt—education, housing assistance, welfare—your district will quickly need to adapt to a new, varied set of cultural considerations. You&rsquo;ll have to find placements in schools for the newly-arriving children of immigrant families, emergency housing for both families and single immigrants, make provisions for health care, as well as identifying ways to help the immigrants integrate into the fabric of the community as smoothly as possible.

    Perhaps the biggest challenges your district will face are in the areas of shelter and education. You&rsquo;ll need to find space to house the immigrants on an immediate, short-term basis—Erfurt has plenty of vacant residential housing available across the city, but a lot of it will require rehabilitation to make it suitable for longer-term tenancy, which will take time to establish. Some of the changes that must be made regarding housing include updating houses to include utilities such as running water and electricity, ensuring public transportation routes pass by this housing, and safety inspections. In the meantime, as refugees continue to arrive in growing numbers daily, you&rsquo;ll need to quickly move to find short-term places for them to stay. Vacant community centers and other large buildings will provide good opportunities for quick-turnaround shelter—but don&rsquo;t forget, you&rsquo;ll also need to secure the basics, such as beds, linens and wardrobes, without spending too much of your budget.

    Education will be both a short- and longer-term challenge. It&rsquo;s not enough to secure placements in the district&rsquo;s schools. You&rsquo;ll also need to take into account cultural considerations, including whether you have teachers or other resource officers who are sufficiently fluent in the main languages of the refugees—Arabic, Dari, and Pashto. Very few, if any, of the immigrants will be sufficiently fluent in German or English. To help the immigrant children better integrate, you&rsquo;ll have to be able to help them communicate, which may mean hiring more trained professionals with linguistic skills, and helping existing teachers and other staff to quickly learn these new languages.

    Beyond the logistics of housing and education, you&rsquo;ll need to consider what it will take to make the immigrants&rsquo; integration into Erfurt as smooth as possible. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy—there will be a lot of bumps in the road. Some in the community will want to help, while others will object. But the Mayor is expecting a proposal from your department on how you&rsquo;ll address the issue. You&rsquo;ll need to conduct ethnographic research among your colleagues and other stakeholders, as well as data research—school vacancies, language resources, and available space for short-term housing. Use this information and the principles of Design Thinking to develop a creative response to the issue. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to be bold—the Mayor is open to all ideas, and how your department deals with the immigrant crisis could be a model for the rest of Germany, and even the rest of the world. Let&rsquo;s get started.
