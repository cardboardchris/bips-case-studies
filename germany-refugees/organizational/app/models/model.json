            "question": "Tell us what you think about the immigration of people into Erfurt.",
            "answer": "Looking at things on a short-term basis, I think we’re able to provide sufficient shelter for the refugees. There are a number of suitable spaces all over the city that can be turned into short-term housing—municipal buildings not being used, vacant apartment buildings, and so on. Most of them will need minor upgrades to be livable—paint, electrical, plumbing. We’ll also need some basics such as beds, linens, kitchen items—we could work with IKEA and charities to cover those needs. Longer-term housing is another question, but we do have quite a lot of vacant apartments around the city that could be used. Those will likely take much more work to be made suitable, as many of them have been vacant for a very long time, and weren’t very well constructed in the first place. But yes, it’s possible to provide housing for everyone."

            "question": "What are some considerations surrounding where we place the refugees?",
            "answer": "I think we must be very thoughtful about where we place the refugees. You can’t put them all in one place, or you risk creating a “ghetto” effect. We have to consider the existing residents, and how we will integrate the refugees with them, if we want them to truly become part of the fabric of this city. We also must be sure the refugees have access to transportation, so they can move around, as well as ensuring there are sufficient services, like schools, doctors, and green spaces. This is a long-term question, but a very important one. If we put them all in one place, like one of the old Cold War-era socialist complexes on the edge of town, that’s not good for them or the community. If we don’t help them integrate, and help provide places for them to live, not just exist, it could cause many problems down the line for us all."

            "question": "Do you have concerns about the immigration of people into Erfurt?",
            "answer": "I do have practical concerns. Our schools would need more resources, more funding, and that means they would have to hire more teachers. I worry about how that would work out, if it would mean taking money away from the classrooms. And of course, the language barrier. Many of these children don’t speak German, which makes things that much more difficult. I saw that the Johannes school is already having this problem, having to find teachers who can speak Arabic. Overall, I think that it can be done here in Erfurt, sure. But there are a lot of problems that can come up as well. I definitely support helping make a better life for these people, but it can’t just be about them—it has to be for the good of all of us. And as teachers, we must have the appropriate resources not only to help these children, but also to maintain standards for the existing students. We cannot just push them aside."

        {
            "question": "What is your biggest concern?",
            "answer": "I worry about the children, honestly. Their children, the ones who are basically walking across Europe—my God, that poor drowned boy on that beach in Turkey. But also, our children. I think the children here will adjust, because they’re so open at that age, and I think that would be a good thing. But will it mean more opportunities for our kids, or less? Will it mean good things for the country? I’d like to think so. And maybe it sounds sentimental, but I would rather have these little Syrian children, these Iraqis, these Afghans, growing up happy and healthy here, instead of dying in bombings over there, or drowning, or starving. Or even more than that—surviving all of that, and growing up to hate the West. To hate us. Clearly, that’s part of where the terrorists come from. All those children who grew up in refugee camps, desperately poor and oppressed—it makes it easy for them to be brought into the fold of the terrorists, doesn’t it? So why not give some of them the opportunity to come here, and not just survive—but to do well? To sort of push back against that kind of bad path, if that makes sense."

            "question": "Tell us what you think about the immigration of people into Erfurt.",
            "answer": "I’m excited to welcome these people, because I myself remember what it was like to arrive in a strange Western country with only a little English. A strange country, with strange customs—but it’s a challenge we can help these people face. I’ve made a home and a life here, and I am safe, above all else. Others can do it too. There are many factors to take into account, though—especially language and cultural considerations. We’ll need resources such as translators and linguists, while we help with language education. We are not alone here. There are many immigrants in the bigger cities with experience in this. We should consider bringing them down to help us with the transition. "

        {
            "question": "Do you have any ideas for how to make the transition go smoothly for these immigrants?",
            "answer": "We could get really creative with this. Maybe we can connect students with teachers or other resources who speak their language in other cities by Skype. We could help new refugees develop a “buddy system” with already-settled immigrants, both here and in other cities in Germany. Locally, we should connect parents and families outside of school, to help them engage with and learn from each other, and help develop social bonds. I think we could look to the UN to get outside help while building local resources. This could be a very exciting opportunity for everyone. We just need to make sure that everyone can acknowledge one another’s differences—cultural, social, linguistic. The Germans can’t expect these people to immediately learn their language, and give up their traditions and customs. The refugees must understand that some of their ways are not acceptable here, and they too must respect the language and culture of Germany. If they are Muslim, there is a lot of controversy here in Europe about women wearing traditional clothing, and especially headscarves and veils. These cultural differences will be an issue, I think, one of many that we will have to overcome together. It will take education and understanding, but I’m confident we all can do it. I’ve experienced all of this myself, so I know it’s possible. We have to help the refugees integrate with the community, and that means we can’t just house them all in one place and leave them there to rot. These people needs jobs, schools, opportunities—the kinds of things that are so important to helping them integrate into Erfurt, and begin making new lives here. Making a new Erfurt."

            "answer": "If you ask me, it’s a lot to deal with both for this department and for the city as a whole. Erfurt already has a high proportion of underprivileged and working-class German citizens who need our help. The state and the EU are going to have to chip in. It’s not just education;  healthcare is going to be an issue too. You’ll need health workers with linguistic skills too, more facilities to serve the additional population. It’s going to be very expensive, our current citizens are not going to be happy, and we are going to bear the brunt of their criticism. This is the kind of problem a bigger, wealthier city is better-placed to handle. I fear we are biting off more than we can chew with this whole proposal."

            "question": "What kinds of concerns do you have that lead you to think your city is ill-equipped to handle this type of problem?",
            "answer": "We’re going to have a lot of trouble with the community. They were here first, after all, and they still need our help. They won’t take kindly to outsiders siphoning off resources and the city’s attention. We’re probably going to get protests and right-wingers showing up, making Erfurt the focus of unwelcome attention. We’d be better off trying to get these people up to the bigger cities, where the infrastructure already exists and is much better developed than what we have. Yes, by all means, take them in, and give them shelter, but only temporarily. We need to focus what resources we do have on serving the people who are already here."
